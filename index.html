                                                <h1>Matt Denman</h1><h3>A new beginning</h3><p>Lets trying a deep test here.  This works a bit better. Something here. Edit things by first used the little pencil edit button on top right of window.&nbsp; Then, when done editing this content, use the save icon that will appear next to the pencil.&nbsp; Cancel the edit by clicking the pencil rather than save. Add some extra text here.</p><p>But this could be how it really should be edited as suggest by someone else.&nbsp; It works particularly well in MS Edge browser too.&nbsp; It's clean and less obtrusive than Chrome's blue border.</p><p>Too bad there are not better controls for editing markup in here, like setting headers, etc.</p><p>Keep editing is not a problem, and there is history of changes made to documents via git.&nbsp; This is another edit after some css. Cool.</p>
